        <h1>About</h1>
          <p>Martin Molin (born 1983) is a Grammis (Swedish Grammy)-nominated composer, producer, multi-instrumentalist, inventor, self-taught engineer and member of folktronica and post-rock band Wintergatan, previously a member of Detektivbyrån. He grew up at Kronoparken in Karlstad and lives in France.

            Molin studied music at the Musikmakarna (Songwriters Academy) in Örnsköldsvik. In 2005, he and his brother Anders Molin were inspired to start Detektivbyrån, after he heard La Valse d'Amélie by Yann Tiersen. The group disbanded in 2010.
            
            In 2011 Molin, Evelina Hägglund, Marcus Sjöberg and David Zandén created the band Wintergatan. The group gained attention when, inspired by a visit to the Speelklok Museum, Molin built his "Marble Machine", a music box made of 3000 components that played using 2000 metal balls. After working on the machine for over 14 months, he released a music video featuring the Marble Machine in 2016, which as of August 2020 has over 160 million views on YouTube.[16] He then commenced work on the "Marble Machine X", a more robust redesign of the machine with the aim of recording an album with it and taking it on a world tour. Molin is documenting the construction process on the band's YouTube channel in a series called Wintergatan Wednesdays. Wintergatan Wednesdays was discontinued after Martin announce that making the YouTube videos slowed down the process of making the Marble Machine X. He now posts irregular updates on the Marble Machine X on the Wintergatan YouTube channel.
            
            In 2017, he presented a series Music Machine Mondays about the exhibits in the Dutch Speelklok Museum. In 2020 he will present a similar series about the collection of Siegfrieds Mechanischem Musikkabinett (Siegfried's Mechanical Music Cabinet) in Germany.
