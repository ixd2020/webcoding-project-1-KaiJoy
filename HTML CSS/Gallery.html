                        Martins latest and ongoing project under 3 years of work.
                        As the successor of the original marble machine and due to it being prepped for world tour the Marble Machine X undergoes full optimisation.
                        Ten months after the debut of the original Marble Machine, the band disassembled it and announced their plans to make a new marble machine for the purpose of touring. The new machine, to be called "Marble Machine X", would solve a multitude of mechanical functionality problems with the original Marble Machine. Martin Molin, the builder of the original Marble Machine, is collaborating with a team of engineers and designers as well as fans for the design and build of the Marble Machine X. The original Marble Machine is now back in his possession after being exhibited in Museum Speelklok in Utrecht, the Netherlands

                        The original marble machine that brought Wintergatan to global recognition and the inspiration for the Marble Machine X.
                        The machine is powered by a hand-crank, and works by raising steel marbles through the machine into multiple feeder tubes, where they are then released from height via programmable release gates, falling and striking a musical instrument below. Instruments played by marbles striking them include a vibraphone, bass guitar, cymbal, and emulated kick drum, high hat and snare drum sounds using contact microphones. The music score is stored on two programmable wheels that utilize Lego Technic beams and stud connectors to trigger armatures to release the marbles. A final music video showing the machine in use was released in 2016, and has been viewed over 165 million times.

The modulin is a contraption created by Martin also known as the Modular Violin.
The pitch of the modulin is controlled by your left hand . With the whole instrument set to the major scale its possible to play in any key.
The volume is adjustable while playing using a wheel by your left hand. using a ribbon detector that detects the users finger position and pressure you can have full control of the entire instrument.
Decay can also be changed using knobs on the instrument.</p>

                        Also known as the music box, the Starmachine was one of the first contraptions brought onto stange by Wintergatan
